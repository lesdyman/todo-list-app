# Let'sDoThis App - Memorize and Complete Your Everyday Tasks

This project is a simple, intuitive, and easy-to-use web app that allows users to write, sort, and check off their to-do tasks or items to memorize. Too many finished tasks and checked items? Well done! Just hit the 'Clear Completed' button. It's as simple as that!

#### Check out [DEMO](https://lesdyman.github.io/todo-list-app/) of the app.

## Features

#### Add something:
Just write something you wish to memorize and press 'Enter'. The input will appear in the table below immediately.

#### Edit it:
The app offers a simple way to correct misspellings, formulations, or the entire text of any task you enter. Just double-click on it and make the corrections. Then press 'Enter' again to save the changes.

#### Change status:
You can also click on the checkbox on the left side of your new task in the table to mark it as complete or vice versa.

#### Delete:
Changed your mind about a task? Or maybe there's another reason to get rid of it? No problem! Just press the 'X' button, and it will be removed from your task list.

#### Sort:
Use the buttons 'Active', 'Complete', and 'All' to sort your to-do list as you wish.

#### Delete all:
You can delete all your completed tasks in the table at once. Just click the 'Clear Completed' button. Want to delete everything? Then use the arrow button in the left corner of the input to mark all to-dos as done and then use 'Clear Completed'. Or press the arrow button again to change the status of all to-dos back to 'Active'.
